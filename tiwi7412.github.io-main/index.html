											<h1>Hi, Iâ€™m Tim Wilson</h1>
										</header>
										<p>My name is Tim Wilson and I am currently attending the University of Colorado at Boulder studying Computer Science. I am pursuing computer science because I enjoy problem solving and creating interesting projects. I am passionate about software development because there are so many different ways to help people and make people's lives easier in these roles. I also love that within software development you can work in almost any industry or profession, because everyone needs software created.
											</p>
										<p> In the field of computer science I think my biggest accomplishment so far is working with a machine learning model and various methods of outlier detection such as KNN, LOF, and more. I thought this was really interesting and got to learn how to use a lot of new technologies such as pytorch, streamlit, and sklearn in python. I have also made some fun projects such as a Battleship game. Using C++, QTCreator, and signal handling in C++, this task was fun and enlightening.  I am looking to join a company that excites when I graduate in May so I can gain experience in the software development industry at a place I am passionate about.</p>
										<p>Outside of my academic pursuits, I love to travel and be outside. I think these both can help me in my career as I am open to new experiences and I know what I am passionate about. I am open and inviting towards change, and I know what will make me happy at work. I would love to be able to work for a company that is interested in sustainability or outdoor activities such as mountain biking or skiing. 
											</p>
										<p>Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about me. I am passionate about computer science, problem solving, and learning, and would love to find a company that I can bring my skills to once I graduate.</p>
