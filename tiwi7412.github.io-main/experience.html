									<h2>Course Highlights</h2>

									<p><b>Senior Capstone</b> - Utilizing public stock data, implementing a machine learning algorithm to identify anomalies, outliers, and tainted data within datasets and data injections for L3Harris Technologies. The model will be repurposed by the United States Space Force to monitor data from satellites on space debris to help avoid collisions</p>
									<p><b>Computer Systems</b> - Covers how programs are represented and executed by modern computers, including low level machine representations of programs and data, an understanding of how computer components and the memory hierarchy influence performance</p>
									<p><b>Data Science with Probability and Statistics </b> - Extracting insights from data, algorithms of cleaning and munging data, probability theory and common distributions, statistical simulation, drawing inferences from data, and basic statistical modeling</p>
									<p><b>Robotics</b> - Autonomous robotics: mechanisms, locomotion, kinematics, control, perception, and planning</p>
									<p><b>Software Development Methods and Tools</b> -  Tools and techniques for successful software development with a strong focus on best practices used in industry; Front-end design and construction using HTML & CSS, back-end database design and construction, and full-stack integration</p>
									<p><b>Database Systems </b> -  Introduces database requirements analysis, database design, and database implementation focusing mainly on the relational model and SQL, but also introducing NoSQL systems</p>
									<p><b>Principles of Programming Languages</b> -  Focuses on the design and analysis of programming languages and their underlying execution models; Used the programming language Scala to explore recursion, functional programming, higher-order functions, immutable values, functors, and inductive types</p>
									<p><b>Algorithms</b> - Focuses on the fundamentals of algorithms and algorithmic strategies; This includes time and space complexity, sorting algorithms, recurrence relations, divide and conquer algorithms, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, linear programming, graph algorithms, and problems in P and NP</p>

									<h2>Work Experience</h2>
									<p><b>Doordash Food Delivery</b> - Picked up and delivered food from restaurants to customers. Managed my time well and completed 97% of orders taken with a 4.92 rating for my service over 800 deliveries.</p>
									<p><b>Safeway</b> - Helped the day stockers, the checkers at the cash register, and the shoppers in Drive Up and Go. Responsible for stocking goods throughout the day, while on call to help others when busy or during breaks.</p>
									<p><b>The Path Bike Shop</b> - Managed the register, answered calls, assisted customers, and worked on bikes. I applied for this job to pursue my passion for both mountain bikes and engineering. I learned about the mountain bike industry while also learning the key engineering principles that make bikes perform through repairs and maintenance.</p>
									<p><b>Mamon</b> - Filled many roles, including food preparation, cooking, and cleaning, and learned to work quickly and effectively to successfully accomplish each of the tasks I was responsible for.</p>
