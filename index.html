											<h1>Hi, Iâ€™m Tim Wilson</h1>
										</header>
										<p> I am a recent computer science graduate driven by a love for problem-solving and a hunger for continuous learning. I am eager to immerse myself in software development at an innovative company where I can apply my existing skills while embracing new challenges and opportunities for growth. I'm committed to making meaningful contributions and fueling the company's success with enthusiasm and dedication.
											</p>
										<p> In the field of computer science I think my biggest accomplishment so far is working with a machine learning model and various methods of outlier detection such as KNN, LOF, and more. This was really interesting and got to learn how to use a lot of new technologies such as pytorch, streamlit, and sklearn in python. I have also made some fun projects such as a Battleship game using C++, QTCreator, and signal handling in C++. </p>
										<p>Outside of my academic pursuits, I love to travel and be outside. Both of these will help me in my career as I am open to change and new experiences. I would love to be able to work for a company that is interested in sustainability or outdoor activities such as mountain biking or skiing. I am passionate about nature and sustaoianability, and I would love to help further the goals of an innovative company that is helping change the world for the better.
											</p>
										<p>Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about me. I am passionate about computer science, problem solving, and learning, and would love to find a company that I can bring my skills to and learn from.</p>
